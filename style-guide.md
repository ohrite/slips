## Last Century

### Designer
"I make mocks of each page of the entire site."

## Meanwhile, in 2010

### Designer
"I attach a mock, CSS and HTML to the Pivotal Tracker story."

### Developer
"I pair with a Developer on implementing mocks.  I sometimes ask the designer about design details."

### Product Owner
"I answer questions about design details that are not covered. I sometimes pair with a Developer on accepting implementation."

## Barriers

**Frequency** –
Design or implementation questions are ongoing

**Goals** –
Questions are usually just the starting point

**Medium** –
Wiki, Tracker and Comments are low-bandwidth

## Solutions

**Medium** –
Choose a very high-bandwidth medium, like the actual browser

**Goals** –
Identifying the actual set of questions is visual

**Frequency** –
Pairing is the only way to ensure frequent communication

## Barriers 

**Implementation** –
Designer is out of the loop after Developer implementation

**Consistency** –
Product Owner may not 

**PM-only Acceptance** –
Designer doesn't see the result

**Design-Accept** –
Design tracker chores
