# Slips

Slips is Doc Ritezel's very impatient way of using [KeyDown](http://github.com/infews/keydown), which is a fantastic way of making presentations.

The Github Page is a [void](http://ohrite.github.com/slips).

## Usage

Slips creation is typically done with guard.  LiveReload is involved.

    $ guard
