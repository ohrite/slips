## Don't abuse POSIX

### It's had a hard life

    My solution to JSON and XML is sed.
    It works in all resource conditions
    and most times is just as fast as
    any RAM hungry parser.

## Do it in Bash!

It's portable

No external dependencies

All developers know a little


!SLIDE

## You've got landmines

rvm: 14599 lines, partial coverage.

EC2 bootstrap scripts: 80 lines, no coverage.

### Your code at home is unsafe.


!SLIDE

## Engineer around it

KISS

Do it in a better language

Make a graybeard do it

## Testing in RSpec

```

  # lib/dude.rb

  class Dude < Struct.new(:indecent); end
```


```

  # lib/pants.rb

  module Pants
    def self.put_on(dude)
      dude.indecent = false
    end
  end
```

```

  # spec/lib/pants_spec.rb

  require 'spec_helper'

  describe Pants do
    let(:me) { Dude.new(true) }

    it "should cover my shame" do
      Pants.put_on(me)
      me.indecent.should == false
    end
  end
```

## Testing Conventions

The Ruby community has some great conventions:

* Separation of concerns
* Environment setup in `spec_helper.rb`
* before/after blocks
* Stubbing and Mocking
* Exception handling

## Testing Bash

```

  # script/pants.sh

  put_on_pants () {
    indecent=false
  }
```

```

  # spec/script/pants_spec.sh

  . spec/spec_helper

  describe "pants"

  before () {
    indecent=true
  }

  it_should_cover_my_shame () {
    put_on_pants
    test "$indecent" = "false"
  }
```

```

  pants
    should cover my shame:                           [PASS]
